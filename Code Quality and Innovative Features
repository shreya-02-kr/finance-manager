1. Code Quality
A. Clean Code Principles:

Meaningful Naming: Use clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, variables, and constants.
Example: calculateMonthlyBudget(), trackExpenses(), viewBalanceSummary().
Consistent Code Formatting: Adhere to a consistent code style for indentation, spacing, and bracket placement (e.g., Google's Java Style Guide).
Commenting: Include comments to explain complex logic, but avoid unnecessary comments for straightforward code.
Single Responsibility Principle: Each class or method should have one responsibility.
Example: A BudgetManager class should handle budget-related operations, not expenses or income.
B. Object-Oriented Design (OOD):

Modularization: Break the application into logical, self-contained classes and methods.
Example: Transaction, Budget, User, ReportGenerator, etc.
Encapsulation: Use access modifiers (private, public) to protect the internal state of objects and provide controlled access through getters and setters.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Use inheritance where appropriate, and leverage polymorphism to extend functionality without changing existing code.
Interfaces and Abstract Classes: Use interfaces/abstract classes for common behavior, especially when you have multiple types of transactions or reports.
C. Exception Handling:

Use custom exceptions for error scenarios (e.g., InsufficientFundsException or InvalidTransactionAmountException).
Use try-catch blocks to handle potential runtime issues gracefully.
D. Unit Testing:

Write unit tests using frameworks like JUnit to ensure correctness and robustness.
Example: Testing methods that calculate balance, apply discounts, or generate reports.
Use Mocking (e.g., with Mockito) to simulate dependencies and focus on specific logic.
E. Code Reviews:

Regularly review code with peers to ensure adherence to standards and improve quality.
