Project Documentation: Personal Finance Manager
1. Introduction

1.1 Project Overview:

This document outlines the design, implementation, and testing of a Personal Finance Manager application developed using Java, Spring Boot, and JPA.
The application allows users to track their income and expenses, analyze their spending habits, and make informed financial decisions.
1.2 Project Goals:

Develop a user-friendly and efficient application for managing personal finances.
Provide a secure and reliable platform for users to track their financial transactions.
Enable users to gain insights into their spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.
1.3 Project Scope:

Core Features:
Track income and expenses.
Categorize transactions (e.g., income, rent, groceries, entertainment).
View transaction history.
Generate reports (e.g., monthly spending, net worth).
Set budgets and track progress.
Out of Scope:
Integration with external financial institutions (e.g., bank accounts).
Investment tracking and portfolio management.
Tax calculations and reporting.
User authentication and authorization (beyond basic user accounts).
2. System Architecture

2.1 Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java
Framework: Spring Boot
ORM: JPA (e.g., Hibernate)
Database: H2 (in-memory) - for development and testing, consider a production-ready database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for deployment.
Build Tool: Maven or Gradle
2.2 System Diagram:
[Include a simple UML diagram or a visual representation of the system architecture, showing the interaction between the controller, service, repository, and model layers.]
3. Design and Implementation

3.1 Model:

Transaction:
Attributes: id (Long), date (LocalDate), amount (BigDecimal), type (enum: INCOME, EXPENSE), category (String), description (String), accountId (Long)
Annotations: @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @NotNull, @DecimalMin, @Size, @Enumerated
Account:
Attributes: id (Long), name (String), balance (BigDecimal)
Annotations: @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue
3.2 Repository:

TransactionRepository: Interface extending JpaRepository for CRUD operations on transactions.
AccountRepository: Interface extending JpaRepository for CRUD operations on accounts.
3.3 Service:

TransactionService:
Implements business logic for transactions (create, read, update, delete).
Handles account balance updates for expenses.
Calculates net worth, total expenses, etc.
Publishes events (e.g., TransactionCreatedEvent).
3.4 Controller:

TransactionController: Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for transactions.
Uses @RestController, @RequestMapping, @PathVariable, @RequestBody annotations.
Delegates business logic to the TransactionService.
Implements exception handling and data validation.
3.5 Event Handling:

Utilizes Spring's Eventing mechanism.
Publishes events (e.g., TransactionCreatedEvent) to notify other parts of the application.
Listens to events and performs appropriate actions (e.g., update account balances).
4. Testing

Unit Tests:
Test TransactionServiceImpl methods with Mockito for mocking dependencies.
Test edge cases and boundary conditions.
Integration Tests:
Test the interaction between different components (controller, service, repository).
End-to-End Tests:
Test the entire application flow from user interaction to database updates.
5. Deployment

Deployment Environment: Describe the target environment (e.g., local machine, cloud platform like AWS, Heroku).
Deployment Process: Outline the steps involved in deploying the application (e.g., building the application, deploying to the server, configuring the database).
6. Future Enhancements

User Authentication and Authorization
Integration with External Financial Institutions
Budgeting and Goal Setting
Investment Tracking
Reporting and Analytics (Charts, Graphs)
User Interface Enhancements
Internationalization and Localization
Improved Security Measures
7. Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the Personal Finance Manager project. The project demonstrates the use of core Java concepts and Spring Boot framework for building a practical and useful application.
